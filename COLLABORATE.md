# Collaborating on Chanakya

<span style="display:block; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid teal; border-radius: 5px">**NOTE:** If you have do _not_ have write access to this repository, then [visit here](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contributing.</span>

Since you already have write access to the repository, you no longer need to fork the repository into your GitHub account to create a pull request. Rather, you can directly push your changes to a feature branch on the main repository.

Let's understand the simplified GitHub workflow.

## The GitHub workflow
1. Clone the target repo to your local machine
2. Checkout a new '_feature branch_' and make changes
3. Push your feature branch to the target repo
4. Create a '_pull request_' on GitHub and discuss with others
5. Make any further changes proposed by others
6. The pull request gets merged by administrator

## Steps involved
* `git clone https://github.com/abraj/chanakya`
* `cd chanakya`
* `git checkout -b awesome-feature`
* Make changes to `awesome-feature` branch locally and commit
* `git push -u origin awesome-feature`
* Create '_pull request_' and get others' feedback
* Make any further changes to `awesome-feature` as proposed by others
* `git push`
* The pull request gets merged by admin
* Good Work!
